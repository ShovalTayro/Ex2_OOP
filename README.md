# Ex2_OOP
In this project and the following projects we will use the same data structure.
In this project  we build the data-structure of the projects :  a weighted directed graph.
Weighted directed graph is a graph that build from nodes and directional edges with weight on every node and edge. 
The weight represent "the price" u pay to pass at a certain vertex or edge.
On the graph you can make several algorithmically operation as like: finding the shortest path between two nodes , finding efficient way to go in a collection of nodes etc.
In this project you can also print the graph and the nodes , using Jframe code.
Graph is represented by collection of nodes and collection of edges.
Node in the graph has some information as like : the weighted of the node , color, his location in the graph etc.
Edge in the graph represent as a line between two nodes, the graph is directional, so there might be a difference between edge a—b to the edge b—a .
The project was develop in JAVA  using Eclipseworksplace.
The graph implementation is based on an  effective compact representation
The interface supports a large number of nodes (over 1,000,000) and 10 times edges  build at a time of less than ten seconds
